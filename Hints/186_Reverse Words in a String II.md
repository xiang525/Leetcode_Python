### Problem:
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
For example,
Given s = "the sky is blue",
return "blue is sky the".

### Hints:
1. split string to list  
2. join the reversed list to a new string.

Option:
what if there is a period sign?  
what if the first letter should be captial?
