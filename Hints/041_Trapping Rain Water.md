### Problem:

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

For example, 
Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.

### Hints:

1. scan from right to left to find max
2. scan from left to right to find max
3. compare the min of the list to the exact value
4. sum all gaps up
