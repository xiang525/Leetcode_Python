### Problem:

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Follow up:
Could you do this in-place?

### Hints:
1. replace with [i][j] with [j][i]  
2. reverse elements in each line   

Q:
Think about using a matrix multiplication way to do a rotation, what matrix to choose in that problem (sin \theta cos \theta ...) let \theta == pi/2
