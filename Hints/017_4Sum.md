### Problem:

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Note:
Elements in a quadruplet (a,b,c,d) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d)
The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.
    For example, given array S = {1 0 -1 0 -2 2}, and target = 0.

    A solution set is:
    (-1,  0, 0, 1)
    (-2, -1, 1, 2)
    (-2,  0, 0, 2)

### Hints:


Q:
1. len(numbers) < 4
2. create a dic to store all possible sum of two
3. pick one from dic and find its remaining in dic as well 
4. match if there two picked out tuple have no common values 
5. return the unduplicate list (quadruplets)
