### Problem:
 Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Hints:

Do it in a recursive way:
D_{node} = max{D_{node.left}, D_{node.right}} + 1

where 1 is the node itself


Q:
How to implement it in a iterative way.
